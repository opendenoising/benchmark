class MatlabDatasetWrapper:
    """This class wraps FullMatlabDataset and CleanMatlabDataset classes. It makes internal calls to Matlab through
    Python Matlab's engine to load one these classes into the workspace.

    Notes
    -----
    This functions does not implement the interface provided by keras.utils.Sequence. It should only be used alongside
    with MatlabModel objects.

    Attributes
    ----------
    engine : :class:`matlab.engine.MatlabEngine`
        Matlab engine instance.
    images_path : str
        String to directory containing dataset's images.
    partition : str
        String containing the dataset partition ('Train', 'Valid' or 'Test').
    ext : dict
        Dictionary holding images extensions. Note that this dictionary should have keys only.
    patch_size : int
        Size of patches to be extracted.
    n_patches : int
        Number of patches to be extracted on each image.
    noiseFcn : str
        For CleanDataset only. Specifies the noising function that will be applied to images. It should be a function
        that accepts as input an image, and returns another image. If you need to specify parameters, you can do so by
        using Matlab's anonymous function syntax (by specifying noiseFcn="@(I) imnoise(I, 'gaussian', 0, 25/255)"), for
        instance.
    channel_format : str
        String containing 'grayscale' for grayscale images, or 'RGB' for RGB images.
    type : str
        String containing Clean (for CleanDataset) or Full (for FullDataset).

    See Also
    --------
    :class:`model.MatlabModel` : for the type of model for which this class was designed to interact.
