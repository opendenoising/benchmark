class CleanDatasetGenerator(AbstractDatasetGenerator):
    """Dataset generator based on Keras library. This class is used for non-blind denoising problems where only clean
    images are available. To use such dataset to train denoising networks, you need to specify a type of artificial
    noise that will be added to each clean image.

    Attributes
    ----------
    path : str
        String containing the path to image files directory.
    batch_size : int
        Size of image batch.
    n_channels : int
        1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB.
    shuffle : bool
        Whether to shuffle the dataset at each epoch or not.
    channels_first : bool
        Whether data is formatted as (BatchSize, Height, Width, Channels) or (BatchSize, Channels, Height, Width).
    name : str
        String containing the dataset's name.
    preprocessing : list
        List of preprocessing functions, which will be applied to each image.
    noise_config : dict
        Dictionary whose keys are functions implementing the noise process, and the value is a list containing the noise
        function parameters. If you do not want to specify any parameters, your list should be empty.

    Examples
    --------
    
    The following example corresponds to a Dataset Generator which reads images from "./images", yields batches of
    length 32, applies Gaussian noise with intensity drawn uniformely from the range [0, 55] followed by
    "Super Resolution noise" of intensity 4. Moreover, the dataset shuffles the data, yields them in NHWC format,
    and does not apply any preprocessing function. **NOTE**: your list should be in the same order as your arguments.

    >>> from OpenDenoising import data
    >>> noise_config = {data.utils.gaussian_blind_noise: [0, 55],
    ...                 data.utils.super_resolution_noise: [4]}
    >>> datagen = data.CleanDatasetGenerator("./images", 32, noise_config, True, False, "MyData", 1, None)
