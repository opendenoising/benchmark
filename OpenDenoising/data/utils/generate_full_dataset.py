def generate_full_dataset(reference_images_folder, output_path, noise_config, preprocessing, n_channels=1):
    """Reads each images in reference_images_folder, apply preprocessing functions, adds noise then saves it
    to the inputs folder.

    Notes
    -----
    We assume that your images are contained directly on 'reference_images_folder'. The generated images (after
    preprocessing) will be saved to output_path/ref, and the images after noise addition will be saved
    to output_path/in.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference_images_folder : str
        String containing the path to the reference images.
    output_path : str
        String containing the path to save the generated images.
    preprocessing : list
        List of preprocessing functions, which will be applied to each image.
    noise_config : dict
        Dictionary whose keys are functions implementing the noise process, and the value is a list containing the noise
        function parameters. If you do not want to specify any parameters, your list should be empty.
    n_channels : int
        1 (grayscale), or 3 (RGB).

    Examples
    --------
    The following example generates a Dataset consisting of 40 x 40 patches corrupted with 25-gaussian noise.
