    Attributes

        Reference to a function that will create the plot.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_dir : str
            Path to the directory containing the files that will be used for constructing the visualisation.
        kwargs : dict
            Keyword arguments. Used for passing optional arguments for the visualisation.

        Examples
        --------
        Assuming you are output your benchmark results to "./results", and that you have a Benchmark with name
        "MyBenchTests", you can use the boxplot function to generate visualisations from the output .csv files.
