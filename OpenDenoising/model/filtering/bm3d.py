def BM3D(z, sigma=25.0, profile="np"):
    """This function wraps MATLAB's BM3D [1]_ implementation available on `author's website
    <http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/>`_.

    Notes
    -----
    In order to be able to use their code, you need to download it
    from the website and add the root folder to Matlab's path through "set_path". By using this function,
    and consequently their code, you are agreeing with the `license term
    <http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/legal_notice.html>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        4D batch of noised images. It has shape: (batch_size, height, width, channels).
    sigma : float
        Level of gaussian noise.
    profile : str
        One between {'np', 'lc', 'high', 'vn', 'vn_old'}. Algorithm's profile.

        Available for grayscale:

        * 'np': Normal profile.
        * 'lc': Fast profile.
        * 'high': High quality profile.
        * 'vn': High noise profile (sigma > 40.0)
        * 'vn_old': old 'vn' profile. Yields inferior results than 'vn'.

        Available for RGB:

        * 'np': Normal profile.
        * 'lc': Fast profile.

    Returns
    -------
    y_est : :class:`numpy.ndarray`
        4D batch of denoised images. It has shape: (batch_size, height, width, channels).
