        model
            Object representing the Denoiser Model in the framework used.
        logdir : str
            String containing the path to the model log directory. Such directory will contain training information,
            as well as model checkpoints.
        train_info : dict
            Dictionary containing the time spent on training, how much parameters the network has, and if it has been
            trained.
        framework : str
            String containing the name of the chosen framework (e.g. Keras, Tensorflow, Pytorch).
        return_diff : bool
            If True, return the difference between predicted image, and image.
