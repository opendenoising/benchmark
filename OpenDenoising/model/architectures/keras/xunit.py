def xnet(depth=8, n_filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), skernel_size=(9, 9), n_channels=1, channels_first=False):
    """xNet implementation on Keras. Implementation followed the paper [1]_.

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is based on the Pytorch version, available on `this Github page
    <https://github.com/kligvasser/xUnit>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    depth : int
        Number of fully convolutional layers in dncnn. In the original paper, the authors have used depth=17 for non-
        blind denoising and depth=20 for blind denoising.
    n_filters : int
        Number of filters on each convolutional layer.
    kernel_size : int tuple
        2D Tuple specifying the size of the kernel window used to compute activations.
    n_channels : int
        Number of image channels that the network processes (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB)
    channels_first : bool
        Whether channels comes first (NCHW, True) or last (NHWC, False)

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`keras.models.Model`
        Keras model object representing the Neural Network.
