        """Pytorch implementation of DnCNN. Implementation followed the original paper [1]_. Authors original code can be
        found on `their Github Page
        <https://github.com/cszn/DnCNN/>`_.

        Parameters
        ----------
        depth : int
            Number of fully convolutional layers in dncnn. In the original paper, the authors have used depth=17 for non-
            blind denoising and depth=20 for blind denoising.
        n_filters : int
            Number of filters on each convolutional layer.
        kernel_size : int tuple
            2D Tuple specifying the size of the kernel window used to compute activations.
        n_channels : int
            Number of image channels that the network processes (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB)
